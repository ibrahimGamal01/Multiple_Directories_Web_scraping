    "about": "Ballahack Airsoft field is the largest airsoft arena located on the East Coast in Chesspeake, Virginia. Every weekend hundreds of players come to battle it out on our 99 acre field. Whether you are into CQB, LARP, MilSim, MOUT or other airsoft game scenarios, we have a great blend of micro terrain, swamps, wooded and urban areas. There is plenty of parking and staging at the field. We’ve held events with up to 1,000 players on a single day. Many people will use the interior staging area and others will stage right out of their vehicles. Inside the staging area is also the registration area and on-site Ballahack Pro-Shop.",

    "about": "The SS Airsoft arena is a 24,000 Sq Ft purpose-built battlefield to provide a well-laid out field with various elements that provide cover for airsoft players. The field configuration changes on a regular basis to provide a unique experience even for our regulars. Environmental conditions on the field can change from game to game. We alter the battlefield environment with lighting effects, as well as varying degrees of fog, sometimes so dense that you can see hardly 15′ in front of you! These different conditions can change the outcome of the entire game and challenge players of all skill levels. Light’s out night-scenario games are also played for a really intense experience.",
