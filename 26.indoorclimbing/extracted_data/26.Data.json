    "description": "The North region of Puerto Rico encloses an incredible marine geologic history back to 30 million years old. Roca Norte is located in a unique topographic landscape called \"mogotes\", which provide spectacular cliffs to climb and scenic views. After hurricane María (2017), 21 Climb and Tour personnel Kenneth Irizarry, Marianela Mercado, and local veteran climber Jorge Rodríguez, created Roca Norte for locals and visitors to enjoy this newly added climbing spot in our backyard, with 39 routes (and still bolting). The hurricane cleared all the vegetation and made possible for us to prepare this unique climbing spot who was hidden all this time at our lands. Probably the most common climbing scenario is entering a public land or park, having all your gear and food with you and start hiking to get to those walls. Roca Norte is very unique especially because most of what is common in climbing is not common here. First, this is a private land who welcomes everyone from all parts of the world, but with a reservation to maintain the area in nice environment. This is the home based crag! own by climbers like you, known by locals and visitors as the climbing heaven cause you can CAMP, EAT and DRINK here, climb from easy to more difficult ones, the rock wall is just at a few steps from your parking, it has a cozy rest area with hammocks and chairs under a beautiful shaded panoramic area. Our facilities include full bathroom with shower. Parking is limited, is always better carpooling. Second we offer different climbing services for experienced and non experience people including children from renting gear for those who are travelling, to guided climbing for those non experienced, belay service for climbers who don't have a climbing partner, top ropes set up for those who don't lead yet and entrance day passes for those visiting for a day. Third we also offer other activities or conveniences such as if its Saturday you can see a climbing movie too at 6pm in a perfect relaxed environment/outdoor cinema and in addition we also sell climbing gear, climbing shoes and chalk."

Um dia de muita alegria para todos os amantes do esporte em que pudemos inaugurar a mais nova academia de escalada indoor, pela localização até daria para chamar de outdoor. Com vários níveis de dificuldade contando com parede positiva, vertical, negativa e teto, incluindo arestas, diedros e fendas, um menu completo para se poder experimentar o esporte com todas as variações possíveis. Com o objetivo de trazer o público para este esporte tão completo e cheio de desafios, tive o orgulho de construir esta estrutura tão incrível, foram 3 meses de trabalho contínuo dia e noite, o objetivo inicial era inaugurar uma semana antes, que seria meu dia de aniverssário, mas os contra tempos não permitiram nessa data exata, mas sempre lembrarei que a cada aniverssário meu será também o da ACE CLIMB. Venham e aproveitem, treinem o quanto puder, evoluam, ganhem força, resistência, flexibilidade, equilíbrio e deixem a vida fluir por suas veias."

    "description": "Wolf Mountain Indoor Climbing Centre first opened its doors to the public in October 2005 and was based in a small industrial unit in Racecourse Road, Wolverhampton, West Midlands. The Centre was hugely popular and attracted a variety of people. However, the demand for indoor climbing was significantly higher than we had anticipated and therefore prompted the search for larger premises. In December 2009, after months of planning and construction, we relocated and currently operate from what was formerly a local authority swimming pool that now houses some extremely impressive climbing walls. Set in a beautiful location, the Centre boasts excellent facilities and offers a range of adventurous activities. The Centre has top rope, bouldering, abseiling and lead climbing walls. In addition to this, there is an indoor caving system, archery gallery, conference room for hire, designated climbing area for kid's parties and two themed party rooms. Wolf Mountain caters for individuals and groups of all abilities and prides itself on the excellent facilities and committed staff team. For the less energetic visitor or spectator, there is a cafe and several sit down viewing areas. Situated near to the City Centre, Wolf Mountain is easily accessible by public transport and for those choosing to drive, there is ample free car parking provision."

    "description": "Ein weißer Fleck auf der Landkarte verschwindet… …nein, nicht in der Antarktis oder im hintersten Himalaya, sondern in der Landschaft der DAV-Kletterhallen. Denn im Nordwesten zwischen Nordsee, Lüneburger Heide und holländischer Grenze war das Angebot an Indoor- Klettermöglichkeiten bislang mager bis nicht vorhanden. Nun begann hier aber bereits im Dezember 2015 eine neue Zeitrechnung mit der Eröffnung des „UNTERWEGS – DAV Kletterzentrum Bremen“ in Bremen. Und das bietet: Klettern auf 1850m2 Wandfläche, innen und außen , Seilklettern und Bouldern, von UIAA-Grad 3 bis 10 In über 180 Routen bei 14 Meter Wandhöhe, für Anfänger und Könner, zum Trainieren oder Schnuppern, allein oder in der Gruppe, Auch fern der Alpen hat das Klettern als Leistungs- und als Breitensport in den vergangenen Jahren massiv an Attraktivität gewonnen. Die Sektion Bremen kommt diesem Bedarf mit dem neuen Kletterzentrum entgegen und bereichert gleichzeitig das Sportangebot in der Region. Die Bremer Halle liegt im sogenannten „Technologiezentrum“ an der Universität Bremen im Osten der Stadt – nicht gerade „downtown“, aber mit Rad, ÖPNV oder Auto bestens zu erreichen. Man muss zugeben, dass das Projekt für die Bremer Sektion nicht einfach zu stemmen war. Es musste Überzeugungsarbeit in der Mitgliederschaft für den Hallenbau geleistet werden, denn von Beginn an war klar, dass solch ein Projekt für eine norddeutsche Sektion in der Größe Bremens eine Mammutaufgabe bedeutet. Aber eine seit vielen Jahren den Hallenbau vorantreibende Arbeitsgruppe und ein - trotz wechselnder Zusammensetzung – dem Projekt wohlgesonnener Vorstand haben im Endeffekt das „dicke Brett“ gemeinsam gebohrt. Und das Ergebnis kann sich umso mehr sehen lassen, die große Nachfrage bei Kursangeboten und die stark steigende Zahl von Neueintritten in die Sektion sprechen für sich. (Aktuelle Mitgliederzahl 4.300). Gute sechs Jahre dauerte es von der ersten Initiative bis zur Eröffnung, bis die 3-Millionen Euro Investition Realität wurde. Den Bauentwurf verantwortete das mit Kletterhallen erfahrene Architekturbüro Gierlinger aus München, die Kletterwände wurden von der Firma T-Wall geliefert und montiert. Als Hallenleiter konnte die Sektion Jonas Loss aus Wetzlar gewinnen, der dort bereits in gleicher Funktion gearbeitet hatte. Nachdem nun im Frühjahr auch die Routen an den Außenwänden geschraubt sind und das umgebende Gelände mit Beachvolleyball-Feld, Slackline und Grillecke „sommerfest“ gestaltet wurden, wird sich das Team der Bremer Hallenleitung nun verstärkt um die Kooperationen mit Schulen, Firmen etc. kümmern, und sicher wird in absehbarer Zeit auch ein Kletterwettbewerb in der Bremer Halle zu sehen sein. Also notiert euch das neue „Highlight im Norden“ und schaut vorbei: UNTERWEGS – DAV Kletterzentrum Bremen Robert-Hooke-Straße 19 28359 Bremen Tel.: 0421 51429053 Mail: hallo@kletterzentrum-bremen.de Web: www.kletterzentrum-bremen.de"

In particolare ci fa piacere che nel nostro territorio, già a vocazione verde/natura per le sue caratteristiche ambientali, si possa praticare uno sport all’aria aperta, andando così a fare compagnia alle altre attività già operanti da anni tra mare e pineta."

If you follow the directions to the Cinema, it will walk you by the gym. On the signs at the entrance this gym is listed under it's old name, 火石攀岩 or Fire Rock Climbing, but is under new ownership. There are 3 auto-belay systems and multiple top rope and lead climbing routes. All the top rope/lead climb routes are color coded by holds or taped. Climbing of all skill levels can be found here. Some of the staff speak excellent English. Cost of entry is 60 yuan if you bring your own harness and shoes, or 80 yuan total if you need to rent. The bouldering is good here. Only a few routes are color coded or taped in some way. They have an iPad that they let you use that has pictures displaying various routes."

We have a large bouldering area (bouldering is climbing 3-4m high without a rope) We cater to many different audiences – from first-time kids to experienced outdoor climbers, and everyone in between. CityROCK is more than just a climbing gym, it is where like-minded people meet and share their passion for climbing. Our coffee shop area has a relaxed vibe and is the ideal place to meet friends, climbing partners and make plans for your next trip. Free Wi-Fi makes it a great spot to interact through your social media network, while having coffee, chatting, or browsing through climbing magazines and route guides."
