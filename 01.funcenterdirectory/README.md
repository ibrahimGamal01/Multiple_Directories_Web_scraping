## Using Code 

1. Run the following command `node 01.js` to scrape the data from the site.
    This run would export the file in CSV, JS, TXT

2. Take either of the formats and make sure it is formated as a JS array and insert it into the code in `01.GLinks.js`
    This code would get the links when available for the specific sites (would take lots of time to run)
    Run the following command `node 01.GLinks.js`.
    It would extract the data in the final format.
