The code for this site is not the same as others as all the data is put all together.

## Used the next regex to Separate the data
| Can try to add more enhancments to the regex if you want.


-  **Improved Regex**: The regex is updated to better capture the name, address, and phone number in a more structured way.
   - `/(.*)\s+(\d{1,5}.*?),\s*[A-Z]{2}\s*\d{5}(?:-\d{4})?\s*(\d{3})[-\s]?(\d{3})[-\s]?(\d{4})/`
   - This pattern helps to correctly identify the name, address, and phone number, even if there are multiple spaces.
