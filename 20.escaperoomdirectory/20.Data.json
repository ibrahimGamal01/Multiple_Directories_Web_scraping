Real escape games entail finding clues that lead to the solving of puzzles, the final goal of which is the escape from the space specially built for this game. This can take many forms but is usually composed of one or a set of chambers. In the latter case , the rooms can either represent different levels (thus, after a new chamber is opened, the one before it no longer has any significance) or create a co-dependan ensemble. For the museum we have opted for the second option. There are real escape games in Japan, America, Australia, UK, Canada, Switzerland, Spain, China and Hungary. Recently the concept has also appeared in Romania (in Cluj-Napoca and Oradea for now ). This type of game was born out of the desire to transform the digital escape the room format into a reality.",

There are separate sets of clues specifically for each of the major roles in a murder investigation. Escapees can optionally split into sub teams where one could be the Pathologist to examine the body and ascertain time of death, method of demise and identify a possible murder weapon; another the forensic team to match hair samples and ballistics; the poor Sergeant who does all the leg work and of course the DCI to oversee proceedings. Where there are only a small number of players they can take on more than one role, or ignore roles entirely and remain as one team to examine all the evidence as a whole. Of course the final clue gives the solution as a normal Escape Game would for those whose powers of deduction don’t quite match Sherlock Holmes!",
